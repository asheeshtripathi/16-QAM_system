# 16-QAM_system
16-QAM communication system.
16-QAM transmitter with gray coding for symbols. Generated 50000 symbols with equal probabilities of four symbols at -3Ep, -1Ep, 1Ep, 3Ep. The energy of pulse(Ep) for this experiment is 6 and it uses Raised cosine pulses for transmission. These symbols are transmitted over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. At the receiver end, matched filtering of the received signal is done and threshold detection of the sampled output is performed to recover symbols in both in-phase and quadrature. The symbols are converted back to their corresponding binary bits and bit error rate was calculated. Plotted theoretical and calculated BER for SNR -10 dB to 20 dB, on the same plot. Also, Plotted the scatter plots, trajectory plots and eye diagram of the in-phase component at -3dB and 20 dB.
